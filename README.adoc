= Neo4j Slide Types
ifndef::env-github[:icons: font]
ifdef::env-github[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

A http://markdalgleish.com/projects/bespoke.js[Bespoke.js] presentation that identifies unique slide types for use in Neo4j presentations.

== View the slide prototypes locally

First, ensure you have a JDK installed.

Next, execute the `build` task using the Gradle Wrapper.
This task will setup Node and NPM, install packages and run the build by delegating to Gulp:

 $ ./gradlew build

The output will be compiled into the [path]_dist_ folder.

To run in development mode so that changes take affect immediately, use the `serve` task:

 $ ./gradlew serve

You can see the result at \http://localhost:8080.

== Catalog

See the <<docs/slide-types#,Neo4j Slide Types>> catalog (in progress) for a list of slide types, their definitions, design concepts and comps and notes about how to apply them.

"They were just there to learn about XYZ, and, hopefully, we delivered -- the software was there just to help.
Which is otherwise a great way to think about any slide deck you ever do."
-- Marcin Wichary

"You _really_ don't need your corporate logo on every slide."
