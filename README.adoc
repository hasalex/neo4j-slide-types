:experimental:

A http://markdalgleish.com/projects/bespoke.js[Bespoke.js] presentation that identifies unique slide types for use in Neo4j presentations.

== Building the presentation

=== Prerequisites

In order to use this project, you only need to be able to run Gradle (specifically, the Gradle Wrappper).
To run Gradle, you need:

. Java Development Kit (JDK) (typically http://openjdk.java.net/install[OpenJDK] or http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle JDK]) footnote:[We strongly recommend using http://www.jenv.be[jenv] to manage the JDK.]

Gradle takes care of the rest!

=== Setup

Next, clone the repository and switch to the project directory:

 $ git clone https://github.com/opendevise/neo4j-slide-types.git
   cd neo4j-slide-types

That's it!
You're all set to build the presentation!
Gradle will setup anything it needs on the first run.

=== Building the static version

You can build a static version of the slides using the following command:

 $ ./gradlew build

The files are built into the _build/bespoke_ directory.
You can view the slides by navigating to _build/bespoke/index.html_ in your browser.

=== Launching the preview server

The preview server makes the presentation available through a local URL.
You can launch the preview server using:

 $ ./gradlew serve

Once the server is running, you can view the slides by navigating to \http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

WARNING: The underlying Gulp task runs indefinitely, which causes the Gradle build to hang.
Use kbd:[Ctrl+c] to shutdown the server.
Disregard the warning message about the task failing.

== Catalog

See the <<docs/slide-types#,Neo4j Slide Types>> catalog (in progress) for a list of slide types, their definitions, design concepts and comps and notes about how to apply them.

Which is otherwise a great way to think about any slide deck you ever do."
-- Marcin Wichary

"You _really_ don't need your corporate logo on every slide."
-- Damian Conway
