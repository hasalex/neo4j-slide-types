First, ensure you have a JDK installed.

Next, execute the `build` task using the Gradle Wrapper.
This task will setup Node and NPM, install packages and run the build by delegating to Gulp:

 $ ./gradlew build

The output will be compiled into the [path]_dist_ folder.

To run in development mode so that changes take affect immediately, use the `serve` task:

 $ ./gradlew serve

You can see the result at \http://localhost:8080.
